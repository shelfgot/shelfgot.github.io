    <p>Shlomi Helfgot built the Torah Library add on as a Free add on. This SERVICE is provided by Shlomi Helfgot at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>I value your trust in allowing this Service access to the Google Document API and the Google External Request API. The add on will use the former to access the user's active document -- and that active document <b>alone</b> -- in order to insert the sources requested by the user. The requested material is sent as a query (which includes none of the user's personal information whatsoever) to a third party, Sefaria (Sefaria.org), through the External Request API, which then returns the desired source material for insertion into the given active document. No other information is acessed from the user's Google account, and absolutely no personal information is retained or stored in any format whatsoever. <b>I (Shlomi Helfgot) nor any other third party are privy to any user's information in any format.</b></p>
    <p>Thus, the Torah Library add on's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements</p>
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
